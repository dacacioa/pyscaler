Documentation and code
============================

Documentation
------------------------

PyScaler documentation is `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_ based. Sphinx is a tool that makes
it easy to create intelligent and beautiful documentation and has excellent facilities for the 
documentation of Python projects.

Sphinx uses `reStructuredText <http://docutils.sf.net/rst.html>`_ as its markup language, and 
many of its strengths come from the power and straightforwardness of reStructuredText and its
parsing and translating suite, the `Docutils <http://docutils.sf.net/>`_.

The usage of Sphinx with`github <https://github.com>`_ along the `Readthedocs  <https://readthedocs.org/>`_
service enables PyScaler documentation to be automatically generated and posted to Internet.

Latest version of its documentation can always be found at:

- `http://pyscaler.readthedocs.org/ <http://pyscaler.readthedocs.org/>`_ (HTML format)
